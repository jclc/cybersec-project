# Cybersecurity Base 2020 Project

This is the final project for the University of Helsinki's Cybersecurity Base MOOC course. The purpose of this project is to exhibit several common vulnerabilities from [OWASP's top ten web application security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

### Compiled Linux and Windows binaries can be found in the release to the right.
Note that you still need to clone/download the repository and run the executable in the root for the templates and static files.
